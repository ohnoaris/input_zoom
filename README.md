# iOS Input Zoom Fix for TornPDA
iOS has a habit of auto-zooming when you click inputs (username, password, chatboxes etc.) 
This happens when the font-size is below 16px and Apple claim it's a 'feature'. This script allows you to change the default size of 14px to whatever size you choose (16-18px suggested.) and removes the annoying zoom from the chatboxes in TornPDA.

**Instructions:**
 *For TamperMonkey install.*
- Click [here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cts0x1/input_zoom/main/ios_input_fix.js)
- It should redirect you to the TamperMonkey 'confirmation' page.
- If it doesn't, simply CTRL + A to select everything on the raw page, CTRL + C to copy, head to your Dashboard and hit the '+' next to the 'Installed Userscripts' tab.
- Click 'File', then 'Save' and head to your [Preferences](https://www.torn.com/preferences.php)
- You should see it!

**Instructions:**
 *For TornPDA install.*
- Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cts0x1/input_zoom/main/ios_input_fix.js) on your mobile device.
- Select and copy everything.
- Head to TornPDA, top left options, and hit 'Settings' at the bottom.
- You should be using the in-app browser, so click 'Advanced browser settings' and then 'Manage scripts'.
- From there, all you need to do is hit the '+' and paste it, type a name up top and you should be good to go!
